# Component Documentation

These base components are the building blocks of a lot of our Webflow sites, and have been built to be easily editable and flexible in any project. They can be tweaked and remixed as much as required, with no limitations or styling constraints apart from making sure they follow the BEM best practices.

The aim of these docs is to give you an idea of how the base components have been built so that you can spend less time reverse engineering them, and more time getting stuck into the design.

As always, if you bump into any issues or spot any areas for these docs or the template to be improved, then let @Curtis Lee know ðŸ˜Ž
