# Styleguide & Best Practice

We‚Äôve developed our own style system to help us build better quality websites, faster. The styleguide also ensures that we maintain consistency across projects so that everyone is aligned on what our best practices are.

We hope to build on this template over time by working out what does and doesn‚Äôt work, as well as add more useful components and base styles where we see fit.

## How do we style our websites?

To make our components more readable, we use the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology. By [using BEM](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/css-naming-convention-bem-block-element-modifier-2ada852a14d3), we not only make our classes more contextual, but they also help us improve reusability across similar components.

If we have a card component for example, our markup looks a lot like how we‚Äôd layer a component in Figma:

![bem-demo.png](screenshots/styleguide/bem-demo.png)

As you move around the template, you‚Äôll start to see how we‚Äôve used BEM to make our site much easier to manage, and even scale with the help of modifiers.

Don‚Äôt worry if it doesn't make complete sense now; Once you‚Äôve broken down and styled a few elements, everything should fall into place (Although @Curtis Lee will be able to help if you get stuck at any point) ü§ì

## What sizing units do we use?

Rather than hardcoding our font sizes using pixels, we instead use more accessible relative units called `rem`.

The `r` stands for `root`, and is related to the root font size that we set. If we were to use pixels, a user who wanted to increase the font size in their browser wouldn‚Äôt be able to as the pixel value is absolute, and therefore cannot be changed.

By using a relative unit such as `rem`, if a user was to increase the default font size of their browser, the text would scale as well.

To make our calculations easier, we‚Äôve set the root font size to `10px` (`62.5%`), which means you only need to think in terms of 10x tables (The pixel value divided by 10):

`0.8rem` = `8px`

`1rem` = `10px`

`1.2rem` = `12px`

You can read more about relative units here: [https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/)

## How do we structure our pages?

We aim to follow [best HTML practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) when creating our pages so that our site is not only consistent and well organised, but also helps assisted technologies such as screen readers by breaking the page structure into landmarks (Nav, Main, Footer etc).

To standardise our pages, we‚Äôve created a basic template structure that you should be able to easily follow straight away:

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 10.04.09.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_10.04.09.png)

Every page SHOULD have the `root-code`, `cookie-wrapper` and a `main` wrapper to house all of the content unique to that page. The components that are the same on every page such as the navigation or footer need to then sit outside of the `main` tag.

To break each section up, we follow the `section` / `container` / `component-wrapper` structure. This makes it easy for us to split the page up into meaningful sections exactly like we‚Äôd do in Figma. You can see this is in action on the Blog page for example:

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 10.03.32.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_10.03.32.png)

These are fully responsive and ready to go, so all you need to do is makes sure you continue that structure as you add more sections.

## What does the template include?

The template includes all of the main class names, styling, components and functionality we normally have to set up from scratch. These are anything from the heading and text styles, right down to the interactions needed to make a modal work.

We‚Äôve also built our own basic CMS structure to handle blog posts and FAQs, along with all of the filter logic and conditionals we commonly use. Although the CMS is fully customisable, the basic structure should give you everything we normally need based on previous experiences.

**Here is a breakdown of each part of the template:**

### ‚öôÔ∏è¬†Project Settings

To begin with, you shouldn‚Äôt need to do too much in the settings apart from rename the project and subdomain, add your own [favicons](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/favicons-and-touch-icons#:~:text=Upload%20your%20icons,-Once%20you're&text=Go%20to%20your%20Project%20Setting,to%20see%20the%20updated%20favicon), and import the correct fonts (Make sure to remove the old fonts first):

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 15.19.58.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_15.19.58.png)

Under settings is where we also handle the hosting, editor access and other data we need such as SEO, Forms and Integrations. We also have a Custom Code section which stores all of our global scripts. The template code shouldn‚Äôt be removed although it may need to be tweaked a little depending on the project needs.

### üé®¬†Base Styles

The styles are split into **five** main areas: Titles, Paragraphs, Rich Text, Colours and Layout. These all have a base styling applied and are what we use to define the projects DNA:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 09.33.13.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_09.33.13.png)

**Titles**

For titles, we‚Äôve applied a base class of `title` to style the colour, and then used a modifier such as `xl` to tweak the font size and weight. If you wish to change a specific title‚Äôs colour, then use another modifier in order to do so. Here‚Äôs an example of how this type of use-case would look: `title` `xl` `white`.

_Note: We‚Äôve opted for the class name `title` instead of heading. Think of titles as the text style, and the heading type (E.g `H1`) as the semantic tag._

**Paragraphs**

Similar to the titles, we have a base class of `text` followed by a modifier such as `lg` to tweak the font size. Unlike the titles, we haven‚Äôt set a colour or font-weight for our text styles, but instead let them _inherit_ these attributes from their parent (By default, this is the `body`).

Make sure you don‚Äôt change the base style for text when building components, but instead apply any additional styling to a parent wrapper.

_Example: If you have a card with centre aligned text, apply the `text-align: center` to the block `card` container to avoid centring all text with the same class name._

**Rich Text**

We use rich text for all of our blog posts, although it can be used for any CMS feed where content needs to be dynamically updated.

As rich text is formatted in the CMS editor rather than as part of the global styling, we often have to restyle all of the elements so that they are consistent with the rest of the site. To save us from this repetitive pain in the future, we‚Äôve created a single `rich-content` container class to automatically keep all CMS content correctly styled in one go.

_Note: You‚Äôll need to manually update the styles to begin with (which we‚Äôve made extra easy), but you shouldn't need to repeat the process again unless it‚Äôs for a very specific use-case ‚ö°_

**Colours**

You can add as many colours as you need to this section, although we‚Äôve added **four** for now just to give you a bit of a starting point. It‚Äôs here that you can start outlining the core palette for a project, and get all of the swatches added for you to reuse anywhere.

_Note: Colour swatches are like variables or tokens that you only need to update once, but can be used multiple times (E.g `Primary Blue`)._

**Layouts**

We predominantly use CSS Grid for big, structural layouts, and Flexbox for smaller layouts that are often at a component level rather than page level.

Grid is great for allowing us to create both simple as well as more 2-dimensional layouts, and Webflow provides a good starting point in helping us do that. Using the native Webflow grids, we‚Äôve set up **three** base containers for you to use anywhere on a project.

These containers are: `grid-2-col`, `grid-3-col`, and `grid-4-col`.

Each of these give us a good foundation, however we recommend using a modifier class to then apply any specific styling such as changing the column gap or breakpoint rules. This should look something like: `grid-3-col` `blog-grid`.

_Note: Not only do the modifiers prevent accidentally breaking the base grid rules, but they are also good for providing further context as to what the grid is being used for._

### üèóÔ∏è¬†Base Components

This page contains a collection of the most commonly used components we‚Äôve built over recent projects. These are by no mean set-in-stone, however they give you a decent foundation with all of the markup in place for you to drag and drop onto any page or section:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 14.32.35.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_14.32.35.png)

All of the components are fully responsive, and utilise both the BEM structure and all of the styles we set up in the `Base Styles` page. You can even copy and paste the components from this page, which we will explain how to do further down.

### üóÇÔ∏è¬†CMS Collections

The CMS is fully functional out of the box for both blog posts and FAQs. Apart from styling updates and adding real content, there shouldn‚Äôt be much that needs to be done here:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 14.49.41.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_14.49.41.png)

You‚Äôll even find a template page for blog posts, as well as the collection pages for all of the blog cards and FAQs:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 14.52.15.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_14.52.15.png)

If you don‚Äôt require any CMS collections for a project, we recommend **ONLY** deleting the `Blog` and `FAQs` pages, but leaving the CMS databases as they are.

We never know if a project is going to require a CMS of some sort later down the line, and it‚Äôs always handy to have the scaffolding in place rather than delete it entirely. You should also exclude the `Blog Posts Template` page from search results, just to stop it being accidentally indexed if it‚Äôs not needed:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 15.02.44.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_15.02.44.png)

You‚Äôll also find a few other template pages, however they are automatically created when setting up single-use collections such as `authors`, and therefore can be ignored.

### üëæ¬†404 page

The often forgotten page has been taken care of. As all of the base styles will automatically apply, you shouldn‚Äôt really need to touch this page unless it‚Äôs to add a funny GIF or change the copy:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 15.13.48.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_15.13.48.png)

## How do I update the base styles?

When you first start a new project, you‚Äôre of course going to want to update the initial base styles such as the font and text colours.

**Updating the global font**

To update the font, you first need to make sure you‚Äôve imported the font-family and all of the required weights into the project settings. From there, it‚Äôs just a case of selecting the body tag (The class of `body` should be applied) and changing the font and base colour:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 13.45.44.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_13.45.44.png)

We‚Äôve also set the base font size at `16px` , or (`1.6rem`). _This font size shouldn‚Äôt be changed as it‚Äôs the default value that browsers use._

**Updating the titles**

If the titles require a different font, then apply that change directly to the base `title` class instead. This can be done using the selector tree on the right:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 13.52.20.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_13.52.20.png)

You can also change the base colour of the headings this way as well. By targeting the base class, you will affect all titles in one go meaning you only need to worry about sizing each one using the modifiers.

**Updating the paragraphs**

The paragraphs work in a similar way to the titles, in that you only need to worry about adjusting the modifier class to set the size of them:

![Screenshot 2022-02-14 at 14.09.54.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-14_at_14.09.54.png)

You can also set a main colour for each text style, however by default we let them all inherit the same base colour from the `body` tag. The sizes we have are also very common and don‚Äôt go any larger or smaller than what is common across the web, so changes shouldn‚Äôt really be needed.

**Styling rich text**

Make sure any changes you make to the titles and paragraphs are also reflected in the rich text:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 14.09.42.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_14.09.42.png)

As tedious as it is, it‚Äôs just a case of manually updating each rich text item and making sure they have the same styles as the titles/text above. _Remember, you only need to do this once!_

**Adding colour styles**

Creating colour styles is exactly the same as adding a style in Figma. Simply enter the HEX value, click the add icon and name the swatch:

![Screenshot 2022-02-10 at 14.13.47.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-10_at_14.13.47.png)

We‚Äôve even created a few initial styles that you‚Äôll commonly find such as `Primary`, so all you need to do for those is edit the swatch and add whichever HEX value you need üñåÔ∏è

## Can I delete the styleguide pages?

Once you‚Äôve set up all of your styles and had a flick through the components page, we recommend deleting the styleguide pages/folder so that Webflow doesn‚Äôt have to rebuild them every time you want to publish.

Don‚Äôt worry - deleting the components page doesn‚Äôt actually delete the components from the `Symbols` tab either, so you‚Äôll still be able to access them.

## How do I use the components?

All of the template components start with the `base-` prefix to help us differentiate the default ones from any new ones you create:

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 10.15.16.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_10.15.16.png)

To use these components as a starting point, you can open the master template in the browser to view it live: [https://nuom-project-template.webflow.io/style-system/base-components](https://nuom-project-template.webflow.io/style-system/base-components)

From there, you‚Äôl be able to use the copy and paste functionality to grab the elements you need and drop them into your Webflow project.

Simply click the copy button which will include the base-prefix for a component or component set, and then in your Webflow project, press `CMD + K` to open up the search and paste the component name.

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 10.29.30.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_10.29.30.png)

This is a handy way of doing things because you get a visual reference as to what the components look like, and it‚Äôs much easier to navigate than having to hunt for a component in the Webflow sidebar...

We also recommend right clicking on the component and selecting `Unlink Instance` if you wish to make any drastic or super specific changes to an element.

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 10.57.07.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_10.57.07.png)

This isn‚Äôt really necessary for elements such as buttons or if the changes are simple, but if you want to start tweaking the structure or creating variations, then detaching the symbol will give you free-reign to experiment without the fear of losing that base component reference.

This workflow also leaves a helpful breadcrumb of what new components needed to be created for a project (Just make sure the new components don‚Äôt start with the word `base` üòÑ).

_Example: You may have multiple card components each with different attributes such as one with a link and one without a link, so this would be a good use-case to detach the symbol and create new ones specific to those requirements._

## How do I create the CMS filter?

On the main blog and FAQ pages, we‚Äôve added category links to allow us to filter the CMS items. All of the logic to make this work has been set up, however there will most likely be some manual adjustments that are needed.

As the main legwork has been done, updating things is pretty easy (Although it can be tricky at first, so help is at hand). Using the blog as an example, the process should look like this (Repeat for other collections such as the FAQ):

<aside>
üí° This has since been updated to use the latest ‚ÄòAttributes‚Äô library from Finsweet (Specifically their CMS filtering and Load-Under functionality).
</aside>

### Updates // November 2022

Thanks to Finsweet‚Äôs latest update, adding complex multi-level filtering, pagination and more is now easier than ever:
[https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-filter](https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-filter)
[https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-load](https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-load)

It‚Äôs also a lot more straightforward to create nested CMS collections and override Webflow‚Äôs default restriction ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt needed too often but it‚Äôs always useful to know if you‚Äôre ever creating a filtering system or dynamic tag list using a multi-reference field:

[https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-nest](https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-nest)

_Checkout the Case Study cards on the [nuom site](https://www.nuom.co.uk/case-studies) to see this in action._

Anyway; to update the filters now, you just need to do the following:

**1.**

![Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 15.33.53.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-11-07_at_15.33.53.png)

Update the categories as needed, and then select the correct category for each post in the `Blog Posts` collection.

**2.**

![Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 15.33.35.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-11-07_at_15.33.35.png)

Make sure the correct attribute value is applied, which in our case is `category` ‚Äî this shouldn‚Äôt need to change, but this value is what we‚Äôll use to filter the cards.

**3.**

![Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 15.33.13.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-11-07_at_15.33.13.png)

Update the link text and make sure the text in the `Field Settings` match. If you want to change the `fs-cmsfilter-field` value, you‚Äôll also need to make sure the attribute value matches the value on the card tags mentioned above.

That should be all that is required. You‚Äôll then need to publish the site to test whether the filter works as expected (Any custom scripts won‚Äôt work in the Webflow designer).

‚Ä¶ Repeat this process for the FAQ‚Äôs, or any other filtering system you‚Äôre working on.

### ** LEGACY **

**1.**

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 11.21.51.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_11.21.51.png)

~~Update the category names for the blog. These can be found under the `Blog Categories` collection list.~~

**2.**

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 11.22.13.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_11.22.13.png)

~~Apply the categories to the correct blog posts under the main `Blog Post` collection.~~

**3.**

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 14.58.59.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_14.58.59.png)

~~Update the link text and make sure their filter attributes match the name of each category.~~

~~üí° There‚Äôs also an `active-category` class as well, which we‚Äôve styled in the `custom-code` embed nested in the categories container. You can control the styling for that class in here, although you shouldn‚Äôt need to change much apart from the background colour.~~

---

## Which domain do I publish to?

When we start a new project, we work solely off of the subdomain that is automatically assigned to the project by Webflow. This is our main staging link that we use to demo the site to clients, test out changes and do any updates.

You can tell which is the subdomain by the `.webflow.io` extension.

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 11.39.11.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_11.39.11.png)

We normally add the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô domain once we‚Äôve built the first iteration of the site and are ready to launch. Once the main domain is hooked up and the client is happy, we then deploy the site and let it propagate. At that point, the site is officially LIVE üöÄ

If you need to make any future updates or changes, we continue to use the staging domain so that we don‚Äôt accidentally break the live site. Doing this is as easy and unchecking the main domain and only publishing to it once the new updates have been signed off.

---

## How do I update the SEO?

The SEO is really simple to update. We normally get given a document that contains the titles and descriptions for each page, so it‚Äôs a normally a case of copy and pasting those into the page settings like so:

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 11.51.42.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_11.51.42.png)

Make sure to add an OG Image as well, preferably `1200x630` in size. This may be supplied by the client, or you can create one yourself that‚Äôs on brand.

Here‚Äôs Webflow‚Äôs documentation on handling these settings:

[https://university.webflow.com/lesson/seo-title-meta-description](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/seo-title-meta-description)

[https://university.webflow.com/lesson/open-graph-settings](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/open-graph-settings)

---

## How do I organise assets?

Webflow generally throws all of the assets into one collective `All Assets` category. For the most part, this is okay as the most recently added assets appear first in the list anyway and are usually very easy to find.

Sometimes you may need to hunt for a certain icon or image though, and if you‚Äôve added a tonne of assets over the course of the project, this can be pretty annoying. To help ease that problem, we‚Äôve set up a very basic folder structure to organise your assets:

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 14.39.57.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_14.39.57.png)

This structure is similar to the one we‚Äôve used on previous projects, and gives you the main categories in which you can organise your assets. You don‚Äôt have to stick religiously to this, however it definitely helps to categorise your major assets to save you future headaches and also keep the project feeling tidier.

---

## Can I remove unused styles?

It‚Äôs considered best practice to keep on top of the styling panel and remove any and all unused styles where possible, and as often as possible.

Sometimes though, certain classes need to exist in the project even if they aren‚Äôt directly being used in the designer (Think spacing utility classes). It‚Äôs always best to check first before bulk removing any unused styles (`Clean Up`), just in case.

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 15.06.04.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_15.06.04.png)

For the most part though, we recommend making sure you aren‚Äôt leaving janky class names such as `Div Block 1` lying around ‚Äî it‚Äôs just good Webflow hygiene as a whole.

We also recommend using the `Embed` block for some classes to avoid the issue of potentially removing them. You can see an example of how we‚Äôve used this method with the blog categories `active-category` class:

![Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 15.07.56.png](screenshots/styleguide/Screenshot_2022-02-11_at_15.07.56.png)

Rather than leave the `active-category` class trailing in the unused styles panel, we‚Äôve instead created it as a separate CSS selector and added the styling that way. This means the JS can still add and remove the class, but it isn‚Äôt detected by Webflow as being an unused class.

This is great for any `toggle` or `add/removeClass` functions.

---

## How do I create new interactions?

We have some basic interactions set up for a few of our components already, however you can build on this and create some of your own interactions if you need/want to.

You can follow the [Webflow tutorials](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/intro-to-interactions?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=general-paid-workhorse&utm_term=keyword-targeting&utm_content=dynamic-search-ads-t1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAr5iQBhCsARIsAPcwRON1Ogu5NbB_iSoANBaEg_hSrmnA_uCYvrjfK6f4VvYiNtXRbgQk8WkaAkX3EALw_wcB) to understand more about how the interactions work, but if you do create any, please follow a similar naming convention to the ones already in there:

`Interaction Element (Function)`
