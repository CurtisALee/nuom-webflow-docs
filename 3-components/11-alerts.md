# Alerts

We have four main alerts including Info, Error, Warning and Success. Despite the icons and colours being different, they use the same Flexbox layout and shouldnâ€™t need to change much:

**A:** The main container which sets the background colour and padding.

**B:** The inner flex container that controls the layout at different screen sizes.

**C:** The icon is a standard image tag that sits outside of the content container.

**D:** The content container holds the copy and is there to allow the flex container to position the items correctly.
